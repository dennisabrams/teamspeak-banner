# Server Group Icons

Server group icons are disabled by default inside the `config.php`.
```php
$groups = 0; // 1 = Enabled, 0 = Disabled
```

## Usage

Put your Icons inside this folder and rename them by their **Group ID** Number and change the file format to png. If your icons arent saved on your server you can always find them client-sided after you joined the Teamspeak 3 Server. You can find them inside the `%appdata%` folder: `TS3Client/cache/YOUR_SERVER/icons`.

## Server Group Icon ID's

Connect to your Teamspeak 3 Server and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F1</kbd> to see all group icons on your server. Hover over the Icons to reveal their permanent Group ID.
